# Innovations-for-environment

This repo contains the dataset which was analyzed, the jupyter notebook where the analysis took place and the output file which is a total cleaned version of the original dataset.

If you can look into the dataset, i converted a lot of Nan values to either unknown or None as they are string values, we cant use any categorical method to fill them or remove them as the number of rows are really low.

A lot of data cleaning and data visualization took place here as it had a lot of columns and no EDA was done as there were no numerical values except for the year launched which was not required in any case to run EDA.

A lot more analysis could have been done, but i kept it short. But, feel free to analyze it yourself and see what patterns you can find out.
